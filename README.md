## Quick Sort

### Description

Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.

### Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(n log n) average, O(n^2) worst case
- **Space complexity**: O(log n)

## Merge Sort

### Description

Merge sort is an efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, meaning that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.

### Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space complexity**: O(n)

## Convex Hull

### Description

The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points of the set. It is a fundamental problem in computational geometry.

### Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space complexity**: O(n)
